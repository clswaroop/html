meta charset = utf-8 - encoding format 

Tags : - usually has start and closing tags - except few - meta,link

-<p> - Block level elements - this will block the entire block 
block level elements occupy entire content width of their parent eg:<body> [however height is only the height of text/image/content]
-<h1> - <h6>  - All heading tags are block level tags 
-title tag [inbody] - It appears when we hoover over the element 

-self closing tags :- 
=====================
<hr> - <hr/> - Horizontal rule
<br> - <br/> - Line breaking
===================
<pre> - used when you have multiple lines - It preserves the spaces that you given in HTML
<pre>
    Name:dsdsds
    Age:23
    Role:QA
</pre>

[in CSS - pre {font-family:inherit}]

inline tags - 
==============
when two imgs /two links added they appear next to each other in the HTML file

 -Inline Tags:
 ===============
-img-src-alt [self closing tag] - Not block level elemnts [only occupies the width required]
<img src="C:////"/>
alt -when the image is not found on src alt is displayed /for screen readers
search over engine

when height of the image is changed - automatically width is also adjusted 
when width of the image is changed - automatically height is also adjusted 
So best practice is to manage only one like above [bcoz rest is automatically managed]

--Links [inline tags]
=====================
-Link to page 
<a href = "www.google.com">Link Text</a>

-Link to section of page:-
<a herf ="wewewew.com" #referedSecion>link text</a> - when you want the page navigate
to the specific section of the page.

- Link to another page in the new tab :-

<a href = "www.google.com" target ="_blank">Link Text</a> - This will navigate the page using new tab 

link has states - visited/active/hoover

use CSS you can style links { a{colour}}
in CSS- to define property for class you use . for sudo classes :
states are styled using sudo classes 
a:visited{
 colour :red 
 font-size: 2em [2 times the original/usual size]
}
a:hoover
a:active 

view port - particular area where the content is displayed 

margin
border -outer area [solid,dashed]
padding - space between text and outer area [top,bottom,left,right]
content area
height - By default content height [if it has one line - 1 line height]
            content height [if it has two line - 2 line height]

Attributes of an element - 
id - unique identifier
class - used when you want to group set of elements to a particular class 
CSS - picks out all elements beloging to .CLASSNAME and then { give all the style declarations in key value pairs}
font-weight - CSS property that controls the boldness of the element 

-Represent data in tabular format  - table tags
-----------------------------------------------

<table>
<thead> -optional
<tr> -column names
<tbody>=optional
<td> - table data

<Caption> tag table detail [centered]

--to give properties for many html elements together
table,th,td{
    border:1px solid crimpson red
    border-collapse:collapse - this will collapse the border of the cells to one usually when you give border it will come as 2 lines border for each cell
}

To make every alternate row in a table to different colour 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Zebra Striping --

tr:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color :light blue 
}

tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color :light blue 
}

Merge cells / span to display 2 email ids of one person 
rowspan="2"
colspan="2"

--Lists
---------------------------------
1. order List
2. un ordered List 

Block level elements
<ul> - un ordered list 
<li> - list item 
style - ul{list-style-type:circle} //Also take value of none

<ol> -  ordered list 
<li>
style - ol{list-syle-type:lower-alpha}


li with in ol 
ol > li : nth-child(odd){
    color:red
}

Forms : - 

<form> - can be done using form 
<form action ="form.html"> - in action you can mention requesting form here it is same form being requested 
<form action ="form.html" method="post"> - when ever you have password in the form use this to encrypt the password text on browser
<input> - a tag for a text box
all <input> should be under <label> and lable had for attribute - for screen readers
<lable for ="nameid>Name <label>
<input type="text" id="nameid"/>
if the data from input element has to go out from form to server then you should use name attribute
All input tags has value attribute to display a default text on browser
<input type="text" id="nameid" name="name" value ="Swaroop Sai"/>
<input type="text" id="nameid" name="name"/>

<input type ="submit" value ="sign me up"/>
<label for="comments">Comments</label>
<textarea id = "comments" name="comments></textaarea>

All select has selected attribute for default selection 

<label for="cities">city</label>
        <select name="cities" id="cities">
            <option value="">NY</option>
            <option value="" selected>PA</option>
        </select>

For adding a multi select box, give multiple ="multiple" - Multi Select box 
<label for="cities">city</label>
        <select name="cities" id="cities" multiple="multiple">
            <option >NY</option>
            <option selected>PA</option>
        </select>

        when the form is submitted - NY will go out but if you specicy value 
        <option value="somevalue">NY</option>
        when the form is submitted instead of NY - somevalue (from value) will go out 

  Check box - [it is multi select]
  --------------
  For check box and radio button the labels are little different - this enables the 
  user to select a check box by clicking on text or the check box  

   <label><input type ="checkbox"/> Web development</label>

   To group check boxes - we have to use the same name attributes 
   Values is must for check boxes
   <label><input type ="checkbox" name ="courses2" value = "web development"/> Web development</label>
   <label><input type ="checkbox" name ="courses2" value = "web /> Web</label>
   <label><input type ="checkbox" name ="courses2" value = "development"/> Web Development</label>

   values goes while submitting the form 

    Radio - [single select every thing else is same except the type ="radio"]
    -------------------
<label><input type ="radio" name ="courses" value = "web development"/> Web development</label>
   <label><input type ="radio" name ="courses" value = "web /> Web</label>
   <label><input type ="checkradiobox" name ="courses" value = "development"/> Web Development</label>

How to reset the form 
-----------------
<input type ="reset" value ="Reset the form"/>

div and span are container tags 
---------------
div - divison - block level tags
div is a block level continer tag 

css - propery float left - will keep the text or links left and 
for block level elements we can even control the width by CSS 
- div used to logical grouping of elements - Like all elements linked in div 
Like all paragraphs can be grouped under a div tag 

.parent > child {
    colour:gray
}

To bring all the links one after the other - by default anchor tags are inline 

link 1  link2 link3 link4 

.sidebar > a {
    display:block
}

Now the diplay will be 

link 1
link2
link3 

<span> is an inline container 
used to - eg: in a paragraph you want to bold only some text
<span class="bold"> Swaroop</span> other text appear next to it 
.bold{
    font-weight:bold
}
span can also hold links - group other inline elements - Group elements but have them inline then use span 

iframe -
-----------

if you want to embed other page inside you page 
like if you want to embed edureka page inside your web page -
however amazon or big sites does not allow their page to be as an iframe on our webside due to 
security threat 
Also iframes help you to display pdf as page in the browser 
<iframe src ="mypdf.pdf"/>

character entities and symbols 

this is guide to <p> tag - here browser misunderstnad <p> as a start tag and add </p> after th g.
to avoid this confusion use &lt;p&gt; - lessthan and greatthan

CSS - 
-Embeded CSS - it is part of HTML file 
-InLine CSS 
Every element has style attribute we can provide it in line 
Eg:- <a href = "www.google.com" style ="text-decoration:none;" target ="_blank">Link Text</a>
-Extenal CSS [preferable - can be re used ]
you have a seperate CSS file and you link it in the html using link tag in html 
<link rel ="stylesheet" href="relativepath">

protocol - how client and server communicates eg: file// , http[80],https[443]
URL - Host+path+queryString
eg: www.amazon.com/gohere?name=hi 
encode + ->%20
Hash fragment - to specific part of a page 
semantic tags :- block level tags - does not add any presentation on HTML page 
header/footer/section/article/aside,figure and figcaption 

header - used for search engines for indexing/make sense for developers
footer - copy write info
article - to enclose independet piece of content and the dependent piece go in section eg: recipe 
section -dependent piece of aricle goes here - eg: ingredients 
if you have an image and you want to add a caption to it you can use it[ you can add span or div as well]

<figure>
<img src ="dfdfd.jpg" alt="msg"/>
<figcaption> adadada</figcaption>
</figure>

<datalist> similar to select - diff - select restrict to only those elements where as
in datalist you can use free text as well
 <label for="cities-box">Select city</label>
        <input list="cities" id="cities-box"/>
        <datalist id="cities">
            <option>Newyort</option>
            <option>San Jose</option>
            <option>Chicago</option>
        </datalist>

 Input types:-
 ----------
 text,password,text-area,select,radiobutton,checkbox,number,date,datetime,email,utl,tel,range,search
 attributes:  name,value,placeholder[this is hint to user what to enter],required,autocomplete
 autofocus,formnovalidate
 number,date -max and min,step [0.5 etc]
 rating-min,max
 search input will have a x mark next to text box 
 required attribute throws errors when u submit a form 
 autocomplete -on - will hint for autocomplete if u once submit the form and helps the next time keep the entire text 
 autofocus- keeps the focus at that point when the page is loaded [usually sets up on one element on form]
formnovalidate [skips validations on form] when added to submit button, user can submit a form with out doing ny validations 
required & formnovalidate are just keys with no value 

File upload - input type = file

<input type="file" name="resume"> - when you submit form with post method, only the file name
will go to server - if u want to send the content/attachment as well 
use this [enctype] <form enctype="multipart/form-data" action=""></form>
use this [multiple] <form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="" multiple></form> - to allow upload of multiple files 

Audio & video-
types - mime types to recognise format
we can use same files with different format as backup as some browsers understand mp3,ogg,vlc etc 
audio -  controls,loop,autoplay 

Local and Session storage:-
---------------------------
every browser give some space to a particular website to store some info 
These are 2 storage options 
browser uses some part of our RAM to store and can be retriewed by local and session storage
each domain will get some local storage 

Persistent:- [long term -permanent -lasts across sessions]
localstorage.setItem("key","value")
localstorage.getItem(key)
localstorage.removeItem

Per Session - [short time] [will loose/be cleared once session is ended]
sessionstorage.setItem 
sessionstorage.getItem 
sessionstorage.removeItem 

For server - use http-server [apache tomcat,iis,ngnix]
server has ears - port is one ear
